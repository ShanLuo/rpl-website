### About the Robot Perception Lab (RPL)

The Robot Perception Lab (RPL) performs research around robotics and AI, especially in visual and tactile perception, with tasks like object recognition, localization and reconstruction for robot grasping and manipulation to advance robot dexterity. The research has three pillars: hardware intelligence through development of high-resolution visuo-tactile sensors to capture rich contact information, simulation of such sensors for Sim2Real learning, and algorithm intelligence through processing tactile data and their integration with vision. The lab was founded in 2021 by Dr Shan Luo. The lab is part of the Centre for Robotics Research (CORE) at King’s College London. The lab hosts several robots including UR5e (x2), Franka Emika (x1) and ABB Yumi (x1) robot arms, and several robot grippers, and has an in-house workshop to fabricate sensors, with several computational servers. The lab has built collaboration with several International institutions like MIT, UIUC, UCSD, A*STAR, University of Bristol, and institutions in China including Tsinghua University, Southeast University, Xi’an Jiaotong University and Fuzhou University, and has hosted visitors from across the world including the UK, Europe, China, Singapore and Japan.
